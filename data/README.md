# Data File

This file contains two different types of data: our credit data frame (in various forms) and regression script outputs.

The main data file is Credit.csv, and the mean-centered and scaled data is scaled_credit.csv.  This file was then split into training_data.csv and test_data.csv

Along with these files there are numerous .txt and .RData files that contain information on our 5 models from the coefficients and errors to correlation data.
