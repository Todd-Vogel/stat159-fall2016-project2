# Data

The data utilized in this project is exclusively a Credit dataset with 11 variables.  Of these 11 variables 4 are qualitative (`Gender`, `Student`, `Married`, and `Ethnicity`) and 7 and quantitative (`Income`, `Limit`, `Rating`, `Cards`, `Age`, `Education`, and `Balance`). The response variable here is `Balance` (dependent) and the rest are predictors. Each data point, or row, represents and individual consumer (of which there are 400). However, the data was trained on a training data set of 300 points and tested on a test data set of 100 points taken randomly from the original Credit.csv dataframe. To make the data more usable the qualitative variables were converted into indicator values and then each variable was mean centered and standardized so they would have comparable scales.
