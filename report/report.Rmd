Abstract
========

The following reports looks into data on credit cards across multiple
qualitative and quantitative variables. We utilize 5 types of linear
modelling, including OLS, Lasso, Ridge, PLSR, and PCR to develop the
most effective predictive model for credit card balance based on the
existing predictors. Then, by comparing the MSE of each model between
the actual and predicted response we determine the model with the most
predictive power (that with the lowest MSE). In the end, we found that
one model proved to be the best predictor of credit card balance. \#
Introduction

This project looks to determine the individual effects (coefficients) of
credit predictors on the response variable, balance. By focusing on
these attributes and applying various models we can determine the
relationships between variables amd, thus, effectively predict the
response. We will apply 4 linear models (Lasso, Ridge, PLSR, and PCR)
and see how they compare to OLS (simple linear regression). If the
models prove to be effective they can be applied to future credit card
data to estimate balance numbers.

Data
====

The data utilized in this project is exclusively a Credit dataset with
11 variables. Of these 11 variables 4 are qualitative (`Gender`,
`Student`, `Married`, and `Ethnicity`) and 7 and quantitative (`Income`,
`Limit`, `Rating`, `Cards`, `Age`, `Education`, and `Balance`). The
response variable here is `Balance` (dependent) and the rest are
predictors. Each data point, or row, represents and individual consumer
(of which there are 400). However, the data was trained on a training
data set of 300 points and tested on a test data set of 100 points taken
randomly from the original Credit.csv dataframe. To make the data more
usable the qualitative variables were converted into indicator values
and then each variable was mean centered and standardized so they would
have comparable scales.

The many of the modelling methods used are found in Chapter 6 of the
book **Linear Model Selection and Regularization**.
